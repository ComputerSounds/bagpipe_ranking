# Bagpipe Ranking
The goal of this project is to create a ranking system for pipe bands across the world.
To do this there are two parts (WIP)
1. Using Selenium, scrape the results from major pipe band association websites over a specific time range.
2. Using TrueSkill, create a ranking table for pipe bands across associations

Stretch goals:
1. Create an accessible repository of pipe band coontents results. Open question: should I put that data here in git? For now, I will
2. Create a website or visualization to show the rankings of bands over time
3. Be able to associate together minor variations in pipe band names. E.g., "Inveraray" is similar to "Inveraray & District Pipe Band"
4. Collect data from all the major pipe band associations world wide: RSPBA, EUSPBA, MWPBA, WUSPBA, the ones in Canada and the Antipodes
5. Create odds and predictions for upcoming contests.
